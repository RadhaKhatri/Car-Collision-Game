# 🚗 Car Collision Game (Three.js)

A simple **3D car runner game** built with **HTML + JavaScript + Three.js**.  
The player controls a car that drives forward on an endless road, dodging oncoming traffic.  
Survive as long as possible to get a high score!

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The player car starts on a 3-lane road.
- Use the keyboard to control your car:
  - **← / →** : Switch lanes (left / right)
  - **↑** : Accelerate
  - **↓** : Brake
- Enemy cars spawn randomly in lanes and move toward the player.
- If you collide with an enemy → **Game Over**.
- Score increases over time (faster at higher speeds).
